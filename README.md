# Hello World

My name is Jonathan. This is the repo for my personal website. It's a Hugo statically generated website that I've hosted on S3 at [www.jonathanjbuck.com](www.jonathanjbuck.com).

The website is kept up-to-date and in sync with the latest revision on GitHub via CodeDeploy, S3 events, and GitHub webhooks.
