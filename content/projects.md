# Cats Vs Dogs [Machine Learning]

GitHub: https://github.com/jjbuck/CatsVsDogs  
Live Website: http://jonathanjbuck.com/cats-vs-dogs/index.html  
Technologies: Flask, ECS, TensorFlow/Keras, S3  

This was an exercise in building a full stack machine learning application. It's a simple Flask app that provides a front-end to a cats vs dogs image classifier. I trained the classifier implementing transfer learning on pre-trained MobileNet model. 


# Travel App [Full Stack]

GitHub: https://github.com/jjbuck/travel-app-dynamodb  
Live Website: http://travelapp-dev.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com  
Technologies: Elastic Beanstalk, DynamoDB, S3, Node, Express  

This was the final project for an online full stack engineering MOOC. It's a Node/Express app for a sample travel application that allows users to log in, create new pages for destinations, and leave contact information. It's hosted on Elastic Beanstalk and uses DynamoDB as the backend data store.
